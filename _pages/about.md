I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, working with Drs. Tony Shi and Tony Schmitz. My research areas are manufacturing processes and systems innovations, with a focus on machining, metal additive manufacuting, hybrid, and smart manufacturing, to advance the next-generation design and manufacturing.

Before starting my Ph.D. journey, I received my BS degree in Automation Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2014. I also received a MS degree in Management Science and Engineering from Peking University in 2017, and a MS degree in Industrial Engineering from The University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2019.
